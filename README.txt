This is really just a continuation of a previous game that I was working on that hit a bit of a brick wall, mostly due to me beinng lazy.

BUT NOW. I have once again returned with something I actually plan on seeing gto the end, or at least having a proper working project instead of something that is half assed done.

Everythinng following this line will just be simple ideas or changelog information just so I can keep track of different versioning.


VERSION 0.1a
-------------
+ Imported important classes from ZorkGame project.
